# gitignore -- make it inside the folder created for your project, so it's where your manage.py is. Add these to it:
*.log
*.pot
*.pyc
__pycache__/
local_settings.py
db.sqlite3
db.sqlite3-journal
.vscode
libraryapp/views/connection.py
libraryenv/ 
# ( if your virtual env directory is a sibling of manage.py. Otherwise, you don't need to ignore it. Change this based on what your venv is actually called. For this project it's libraryenv. For others you might call it something else ) 
libraryapp.session.sql 
# ( Or whatever you named your connection to the db with SQLTools )
